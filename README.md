# Pizza Utils

`git clone` this repo and run `install.sh` as a makeshift, easy to use and manage package manager for useful scripts I've made.

To automate the installation, you can run 
`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL 'https://gitlab.com/mredig/pizza-utils/-/raw/main/remote-install.sh?ref_type=heads')"`
from the command line to automatically download and install the repo (assumes you have git and a compatible `sh`
interpretter)
